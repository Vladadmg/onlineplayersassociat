RTG Face Up 21 

 






Face Up 21 is another variation of Blackjack. Like Blackjack, the goal is to get closer to 21 points than the dealer without going over 21 points. However, in Face Up 21, both of the dealer's cards are shown face up. Face Up 21 offers a special payout on the two-card, 21-point hand called "Blackjack" and allows you to split your hand and double your bet to maximize you payout.
