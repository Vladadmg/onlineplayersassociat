 <tr><td class=heller><a name=casino><b>Why should a casino join the OPA?</b><br>

<p>Honest and efficient online casinos have everything to gain from joining the Online Players' Association as a casino member, primarily because it brings the operation into close and frequent proximity with a significant pool of regular online gamblers of integrity who have subscribed to the Association's <a href="ethics.html" class="bold">Code of Ethics</a> and Conduct.</p>  

<p>One of the OPA's major goals is to bring honest, genuine online gamblers into contact with casinos of quality and integrity.</p>

<p>OPA Casino Members apply <a href="join_casinos.html" class="bold">here</a> free of charge and must agree to the Association's Casino <a href="ethics.html" class="bold">Code of Conduct and Ethics</a>.</p>

<tr><td class=heller><a name=structured><b>How is the OPA structured?</b><br>
The OPA is managed by Bryan Bailey of Casinomeister.  He forms the Executive Committee charged with the day to day running and administration of the Association, which he does on a "NOT FOR PROFIT" basis.  <br>
<br> 
Communicating directly with him on a day to day advisory and voting basis is a group of between seven and nine voluntary executive advisers.  The majority of these are experienced online players, but there is also a cross-section of industry specialists to give balance and broader knowledge.  The executive advisers are supported by volunteers who undertake specific tasks ie complaints, finance, business, mediation, legal, research, consumer action strategies, technology, gambling opinion and communications.  <br>
<br> 
Operating independently of the executive advisers, and with its own direct access to the Management Committee is the Players' Advisory Board (PAB).  This is made up of over sixty highly experienced and regular online players who act as a sounding board for the Association and carry out unannounced testing of projects and casinos in order to furnish reviews and large volume data samples to the committee, together with recommendations.

<tr><td class=hell><a name="pab"></a><b>What is the Player Advisory Board</b><br>

The entire committee is supported by a large Player Advisory Board (PAB). When a casino submits an application to the OPA for consideration, the PAB gives experienced player input. This body is totally autonomous and has it's own communication forum from which the committee are excluded to allow total freedom of expression.<br>

<tr><a name="complaints"></a><td class="heller"><b>How are casino complaints handled?</b><br>
<br>
This is what happens when a dispute is submitted:
<br>
<br>
<p><b>1.</b> When the complaint is received, it is checked to ensure the casino in question isn't on the "Not Recommended" list. If it is, we are unable to assist since in most cases these casinos are unresponsive, have ceased negotiations with us in the past, or are just plain troublesome. </p>

<p><b>2.</b> The dispute is then passed over to the Casino in question. </p>

<p><b>3.</b> If The Casino <i>is</i> a member of the OPA, we expect a resolution in 48 hours, a resolution does not necessarily mean a player is paid as history has shown us a small minority of disputes are from less than honest players. But most OPA Approved Casinos respond very promptly and the dispute is resolved.</p> 

<p><b>4.</b> If the Casino is not a member of the OPA - (this is our largest work load) and can be one of the most frustrating parts of the service for both us and the player. A large amount of casinos will respond promptly and offer an official solution to the problem which is cascaded to the player; however, a number of casinos will prove to be either non-responsive or non-helpful. We receive some disputes that run for weeks and we are given a myriad of excuses. We do list these on our weekly round-up section which is now in our forum.  Unless a casino has responded it will take a little longer to sort out the dispute. We do allow a preset time frame for the casino to address our concerns before putting them on the weekly round up section. We find this helps usher a non-responsive casino to partake in a meaningful exchange. But some of these casinos wind up on the "Not Recommended" list once the advisory board decides it warrants such action. </p>

<tr><td class=heller><a name="approved"></a><b>How do casinos get on the OPA's "Approved" and "Not Recommended" lists?</b> <br>
<br>

<p>OPA "Approved Casinos" apply for membership of the Association, giving full details regarding gambling software, ownership, licencing, e-cash and other pertinent information.  The executive advisers, aided by input and opinion from the PAB then research the casino and ownership track record for excessive complaints and inspect the entire website.  If the casino complies with the requirements of the Association and agrees to the Casino Code of Conduct and Ethics it is approved for membership, which automatically positions it on the OPA Approved List.  Casinos that do not adhere to the standards of good practise and integrity required by the OPA may, for good cause openly heard be removed from both membership and approved list.</p>
 
<p>The OPA operates a "Not Recommended" list of casinos in order to protect its members.  Casinos, and occasionally turnkey providers with a consistently bad and recurring record are placed on this list through the following procedure. The offending casino usually comes under the spotlight as the result of a legitimate and factual member complaint/s.  The OPA has a policy of always giving the accused operation the opportunity to defend itself and/or negotiate an appropriate solution to the complaint.  If the accused casino ignores  OPA attempts to mediate, or refuses to negotiate a fair deal then the committee will draw up a report with recommendations and submit it to the executive advisers for a decision.  After any research or checks that it may feel are required, including reference to the PAB or other resources, the advisers vote on every "Not Recommended" listing.</p>
<a href="#top" class="minibold">Back to top</a></td></tr>

<tr><td class=hell><a name=removed><b>Can a casino clear its name and be removed from the "Not Recommended" list?</b><br>
 
<p>Yes. Any operation on the NR list can apply to the Association to clear its name by a re-hearing of the case, a re-negotiation of the dispute/s or by showing that it has made full restitution to any player prejudiced by the conduct of which it stood accused.  Such an application will be considered by the executive advisers and the committee, accompanied by further updated research into the accused casino's current reputation and status.</p></td></tr>
 
<tr><td class=heller><a name=complaints1><b>Will the OPA accept complaints in respect of casinos on its "Not Recommended" list?</b><br>
<p>In the normal course of events, no. The Association makes considerable effort to protect its members, and the feeling is that if members choose to ignore such warnings they have only themselves to blame when things go wrong.  However, the OPA is not inflexible and where a genuine case is presented, or a large number of members have been prejudiced so as to constitute a "class action" scenario, it will consider taking on complaints regarding NR casinos.</p>

<br><a href="#top" class="minibold">Back to top</a>

</td></tr>
 
<tr><td class=hell><a name=lose><b>Can player members lose their membership?</b><br>
<p>Yes, usually for serious infringments of the Players' Code of Conduct and Ethics which is in place to make sure that OPA players remain fair, truthful and honest gamblers.  The Association will always listen carefully to its members' suggestions and comments that are responsibly made, but expects a reasonable level of loyalty and support in return.  Members who consistently "trash" or attempt to discredit the Association through message boards or emails can be asked to explain themselves.  Should that explanation prove unacceptable, the member can be expelled by a majority vote of the executive advisers and the committee after a fair hearing where evidence of the members' conduct has been examined.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td class=heller><a name="conditions"><b>Are there any conditions regarding submission of a complaint?</b>
 
<p>No - the Association assumes that your complaint is factual, genuine, truthful and justified pending the response from the casino that you accuse.  For practical reasons, the OPA recommends that players do not immediately start to "trash" or abuse the accused casino on message boards or other venues.  This obviously complicates the resolution process and is not in the interests of anyone involved.</p>

<a href="#top" class="minibold">Back to top</a>

</td></tr>
 
<tr><td class=hell><a name="bad"><b>What does the OPA consider as "Bad casino practise"?</b>
 
<ul><li>Any prejudice to a player's privacy rights. eg revealing a player's identity without permission, or his or her playing record.</li>
 
<li>Any attempt to change T&amp;Cs and then retroactively apply same to players whose wagers have already been accepted under the original T&amp;Cs.</li> 
 
<li>Attempts to disqualify the payouts due to a player on grounds of "bonus abuse" when said player has fully complied with all the requirements of the casino T&amp;Cs in force at the time his or her wager was accepted by the casino, thus effectively forging a "contract".</li>  
 
<li>Similarly, attempts to expel a player on "right of admission" grounds without making payouts due to him where the casino has already accepted his or her wager in compliance with its T&Cs.  Note: The OPA has no problem with a casino exercising its Right of Admission by expelling a player after paying amounts due to him or her.  The OPA equally has no problem with a casino exercising its Right of Admission for whatever reason before the player's wager has been accepted. In other words, the OPA is against Right of Admission being used retroactively as a device to avoid paying out a player. </li>
 
<li>Casinos which use negative databases to deny player payouts due where those databases are not identified and where those databases do not give the player the right of appeal against his or her inclusion.  The spirit of this objection is that persons being placed on a negative database should have the right to  face their accusers and defend themselves.</li>
 
<li>Any practise which involves repeated disqualifications of player payouts on grounds of recurring "software glitches". The OPA feels that the casino has a responsibility to ensure that its software is operating efficiently. Using the same excuse repeatedly indicates a software fault and not a player fault.</li>
 
<li>Any practise which is subsequently shown by expert examination to involve unfair gambling software.</li>
 
<li>The practise of sending a player "promo" emails inviting his or her participation in a specific bonus or other promotion, and then disqualifying him or her post wager on the grounds that he/she is not on the loyalty/VIP/promo list. The OPA believes that the casino has a resonsibility to ensure the accuracy of its own promo emailing list, and that it also has a resonsibility to exclude prior to wagering anyone the management does not wish to participate in that particular promotion.</li>
 
<li>Any practise that unduly and unreasonably delays payouts due and legitimately requested by a player. This embraces well-worn cashflow excuses like "audits" that do not freeze deposits as well as payouts, "change of e-cash processor causing problems" or the like. The OPA believes that casinos should honour the payout times they promise on their sites, typically five to seven days but that in any case no payout should take longer than 30 days.</li>
 
<li>Casinos that invoke the "multiple account" ruling to disqualify payouts due, when the player's activity is at another casino in the same ownership group but the casinos involved have not taken steps to inform the player of the other casinos to which they are related and in respect to which the rule is being applied.</li>
 
<li>Casinos that double charge a player.</li>
 
<li>Casinos that send unsolicited marketing emails to players ("spam") and continue to do so despite requests to desist.</li>
 
<li>Casinos where the management or the Support representatives offer unprovoked abuse. threatening behaviour or false information to players.</li></ul>
